#Introduction

I'll be going through the challenges at the [Daily Programmer][1] subreddit. As a fairly new programmer (as of 8/15/2013), I plan to start off with the easier ones, and build up from there. Most of these programs will be in Java, and other languages used will be noted if it happens.


#Completed Challenges

-	[Challenge 134 [Easy] N-Digit Divisible:][2] Find the largest number with N digits that is divisible by M.
-	[Challenge 132 [Easy] Greatest Common Divisor:][3] Find the greatest common divisor from any two given numbers.
-	[Challenge 127 [Easy] McCarthy 91 Function:][4] Correctly use the McCarthy 91 Function with any given number.
