###[Challenge 134 [Easy] N-Digit Divisible][1]

*Last Update: 8/15/2013*

DivisibleDigits takes two integers, N and M, and finds the largest integer of N digits that is evenly divisible by M. N will always be greater than 1, and M will always be greater than 2.

For example, if you are given an N of 3 and an M of 2, the largest 3-digit integer that is evenly divisible by 2 is 998.
