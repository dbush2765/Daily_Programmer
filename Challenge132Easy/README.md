###[Challenge 132 [Easy] Greatest Common Divisor][1]

*Last Update: 8/15/2013*

The Greatest Common Divisor of a given set of integers is the greatest integer that can divide these integers without any remainder. From Wikipedia, take a look at this example: for the integers 8 and 12, the highest integer that divides them without remainder is 4.

Your goal is to write a program that takes two integers, and returns the greatest common divisor. You may pick any algorithm or approach you prefer, though a good starting point is Euclid's algorithm.
